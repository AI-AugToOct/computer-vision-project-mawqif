# 🚗 Parking Violation Detection (Deep Learning Models)

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for training and evaluating deep learning models to detect and classify **parking violations**.  
The dataset was annotated using [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/), where bounding boxes were created to identify vehicles and determine whether they are parked correctly.
